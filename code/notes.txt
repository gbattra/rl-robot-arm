Actor Critic:
    Catastrophic Collapse:
        What:
            - Performance would suddenly collapse around episode 60
        Why:
            - The total loss was negative, as the critic loss was zero but the actor loss was negative
            - This caused the critic to upate its state values in the negative direction
        Fix:
            - Squaring the actor loss resolved this collapse but damped Performance
            - Scaling the actor loss by a factor alpha fixed the issue without hampering Performance
    
    Variance Reduction:
        What:
            - Learning is often unstable and prone to large swings
        Why:
            - Stochastic GD results in biases in small batches having big impacts on the weight updates
        Fix:
            - More envs generating more samples per step
            - Bigger batch sizes
